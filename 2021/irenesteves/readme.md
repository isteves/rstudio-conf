# The dynamic duo: SQL & R

There's a point in every data wranglers' career in which their full dataset can no longer fit into just CSV files, and the journey to database-world begins. I reached this point about two years ago, when I transitioned from ecological research to the world of eCommerce fraud prevention. My calls to read_csv became scarcer as I came to rely more and more on databases. In this talk, I'll demonstrate how I use R and SQL to access database tables, and how I incorporate both into my daily workflow, aided by features in RStudio IDE. I'll also discuss our companyâ€™s "riskiconn" package for handling database connections and queries, which includes customizations to simplify day-to-day data querying.

# Speaker bio

Irene holds an M.Sc. in Ecology and a B.A. in Integrative Biology, through which she first discovered R and data science. Her interest in data led her to the Arctic Data Center at the University of California Santa Barbara, a summer internship at RStudio, and ultimately to the Research & Data Science department at Riskified, where she now explores the complex patterns of fraud in eCommerce. In her free time, she studies Hebrew through podcasts and dubbed kids' movies.
